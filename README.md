# Decision-Trees-MN-Housing-Price-Predictor

This notebook is based off of the Kaggle intro to machine learning course. The code from this course is altered to reflect my data. I do not use the data from the kaggle course. Instead, I have used the RapidAPI to generate 200 listings from the Minneapolis, MN. I then convert the JSON Format into a Pandas DataFrame and get to work on learning decision trees.

I create two decision trees and one random forest model.
The first tree is a simple test to show how it works. The second tree is using a max leaf test to find the optimal node count.
The last is a simple random forest model.

The models show that as you optimize the model they generally perform better, not surprising. However, this was my first decision tree model and was generally happy with how it turned out especially with real world data.
